			<p>How can the story of religion in the United States in a digital age? What questions can be asked using tools such as text-mining and geospatial analysis? These are the questions that motivate my academic pursuits.</p>
			<p>I am something of a wanderer in the humanities. I started my undergraduate as an English major and soon added a Philosophy major. I then went to Divinity School for my masters and have a Master of Arts in Religion, with a concentration in the History of Christianity. I am currently working on my PhD in U.S. History with a focus on religion and culture in the 19th century and on digital scholarship. Despite the challenges of switching fields, I find the variety of experiences to be helpful for both of my areas of focus.</p>
			<p>I am always interested in new ideas, perspectives, and projects. You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jeriwieringa">twitter</a> or can contact me through email at jwiering [at] gmu [dot] edu.</p>
